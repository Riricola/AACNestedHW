Mini Project 5

AACNestedHW is a project that takes starter code and documentation from Catie Baker's project directory. When run, the
code creates an Augmentative and Alternative Communication device that reads in a file and creates upper level categories
and feeds in images and text into those categories based on the file. AACCategory creates an array that stores all of the
images and texts to be spoken by a functioning Text to Speech robot. AACMappings stores the mapping of the images on the 
home page to the AACCategories. The AAC device menu had added features such as a 'home' button, a 'save' button, and a '+'
button.
